-----------

* Load and preprocess the Iris dataset  
* Train a **Logistic Regression model**  
* Predict flower species based on input features  
* Evaluate performance using accuracy score  
* Simple and easy-to-understand classification project  

🛠️ Technologies Used
---------------------

* **Python**  
* **Pandas** & **NumPy** – Data handling and processing  
* **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** – Visualization  
* **Scikit-learn** – Machine Learning (Logistic Regression)
